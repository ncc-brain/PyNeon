    "## Mapping Gaze Data to Video Frames\n",
    "\n",
    "In Neon recordings, gaze events are not naturally synchronized with the video. To map gaze data to specific video frames, we can use the `map_gaze_to_video` method. This method requires the `pyneon.video` object for determination of video timestamps, the `pyneon.fixations` object to make use of PupilLabs fixation detection pipeline and the `pyneon.gaze` object for improved time resolution of gaze estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Neon reports fixations with a single coordinate. This is computed as average between all gaze coordinates over the interval denoted as a fixation. However, this clashes with the functional definition of a fixation as _tracking a fixed point in space_, used by Neon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine looking at a fixed point, for example a street sign, while you are walking past it. Despite the movement of your body and the relative movement of the sign, the fixation will be stabilized. As such, taking an average gaze coordinate over the entire duration will not correspond to the location of the sign, or the fixation, at any given point in time. Feeding this point into an optical flow algorithm would, with high likelihood, lead to tracking anything but the sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we use partial averages of gaze locations around the respective frame's timestamp. As the video is sampled at 30Hz while the gaze output nominally reaches 200Hz, we expect to take the average over 6 subsequent gaze points. This achieves a trade-off between recency of the reported gaze position at the given frame and error minimization, by averaging over microsaccades around the actual fixation target as well as random errors."

In dynamic scenes, the same object will not occupy the same scene-camera location over time. Therefore, we need to continuously map past fixation points as long as they are still visible in the frame.\n",

    "The `estimate_scanpath` method achieves this by feeding fixation point denoted as `end` into a Lucas-Kanade sparse optical flow algorithm. This algorithm compares the video in vicinity of the point with the subsequent frame, updating the location in dependence of its movement. While a point is tracked, its status is flagged as `tracked`. In practice, many scene frames will have multiple simultaneously present past fixations. Our implementation carries them and repeately performs an optical flow estimation for each point. Only when they can no longer be tracked, will they be flagged as `lost` and subsequently dropped for the next frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that this algorithm is not optimised for performance and that it will take a considerable amount of time to run on limited hardware. For our computers, the algorithm takes roughly half the time of the video, though this benchmark heavily depends on the density of past fixation points and computational ressources\n"
